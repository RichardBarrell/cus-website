      <h2>Profile:</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior software developer with a range of skills. I have
        extensive recent experience with TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am comfortable talking directly to clients and am friendly and
        personable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would describe myself as an "everything programmer": I have on
        multiple occasions learned and used a new programming language or tech
        stack from scratch, in order to deliver software for which the company's
        main tech stack was not available.
      </p>
      <p>I am a British citizen and hold a valid passport.</p>

        The principal tech stacks I worked with at Calvium were React Native and
        Expo for mobile apps; React with Vite or NextJS for web apps, and NodeJS
        for app back-ends. Most code at Calvium was written in TypeScript.
