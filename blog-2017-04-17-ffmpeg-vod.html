  Occasionally, I want to record myself playing a videogame. I use Nvidia's
  ShadowPlay for this, which sorta got renamed to “GeForce Experience” a while
  back. I don't currently attempt to stream video because the internet
  connection I have right now doesn't have enough upstream bandwidth.
</p>

<p>For high-quality smooth VOD recording:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You want hardware-accelerated h264 encoding. Both Nvidia and AMD GPUs now
    come with hardware for video encoding and they publish APIs for it. The GPU
    vendors' own software (like ShadowPlay) uses this, but so will decent 3rd
    party video capture software. The benefit of this is that it makes recording
    have no appreciable effect on framerate.
  </li>
  <li>
    You want to stream the video onto a different hard drive than the one which
    the videogame you are playing is installed. This makes recording not affect
    loading times very much, though it'll still make them a little worse by
    consuming some RAM. It also avoids having the game deprive the video stream
    of needed disk throughput, which ties in to the next point.
  </li>
  <li>
    You want to stream the video onto a hard drive which is otherwise idle. I
    would expect a plug-in USB 2.0 hard disk to be fast enough. It will need to
    sustain about 5MB/s of writes. USB2 can do about 30 to 35MB/s. Your
    recording software can buffer saved video in memory only briefly. If the
    disk you're streaming the video onto sometimes fails to keep up, you'll get
    gaps and skipping in the VOD file.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As for video quality, I found that the Nvidia hardware encoder (at least with
  my GPU, a GeForce 650Ti) is not very good at producing compact, high-quality
  video files. It can produce files that are almost small enough, but at abysmal
  quality. Alternatively, it can produce files that are high enough quality,
  high far too large. In order to get around this, what I do is:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    I record with all the quality settings in ShadowPlay set to maximum. That
    is, 1080p resolution, 60Hz framerate and 50Mbit/s bitrate.
  </li>
  <li>
    I use a command-line program called ffmpeg to re-encode them to much smaller
    files (about 10% to 20% the size) with only slightly lower quality.
  </li>
  <li>
    I check that the recompressed output files look okay, then delete the
    original huge VOD files.
  </li>
  <li>I upload the recompressed output files to YouTube overnight.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  If you are uploading to YouTube, YouTube will re-encode your video on their
  servers. I believe this is partly so that YouTube can control video formats
  and bitrates themselves, and partly so that YouTube can prevent miscreants
  from breaking into other peoples' computers by uploading malformed video files
  with exploits in them.
</p>

<p>
  As far as I can tell, for game recordings on YouTube it's best to upload video
  files at 60Hz framerate and 1080p resolution. I think this is because the
  ratio of bitrate to pixels that YouTube gives you is roughly constant, so the
  more pixels you shove in, the more frame coherence the encoder can take
  advantage of to make your pixels be pretty within its bitrate budget. Trying
  to get “fewer pixels, but more bits per pixel” on YouTube does not appear to
  work; if you downscale a video to 720p before uploading, YouTube will give you
  a lower bitrate than if you had uploaded it at 1080p.
</p>

<p>The ffmpeg command that I use for reencoding a video from ShadowPlay is:</p>

<code class="code-block"
  >ffmpeg -i <em>input_file_from_shadowplay.mp4</em> \ -c:a copy \ -c:v libx264
  -bf 2 -flags +cgop -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 28 \ -preset slow \
  <em>output_file_from_ffmpeg.mkv</em></code
>

<p>
  On my desktop computer with an Intel i3-4130 CPU, this takes roughly 3 seconds
  to encode each second of input video. It produces output files at about 6
  Mbit/s (or about 45 megabytes per minute). Here are a couple of examples of
  what the output quality from that looks like, after being uploaded to Youtube:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9VDVQIoX04"
      >Boganella is the best gun.</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G7GPEtkWu8"
      >Racecourse on Hossin! We drive around it for a bit.</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The ffmpeg command that is recommended (according to
  <a
    href="https://www.virag.si/2015/06/encoding-videos-for-youtube-with-ffmpeg/"
    >Jernej Virag's helpful post</a
  >) is:
</p>

<code class="code-block"
  >ffmpeg -i <em>input_file_from_shadowplay.mp4</em> \ -c:a aac -b:a 384 -r:a
  48000 \ -c:v libx264 -bf 2 -flags +cgop -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 21 \ -preset
  slow \ <em>output_file_from_ffmpeg.mkv</em></code
>

<p>
  There are two differences between the one I'm using in practice and the
  recommended one.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The one I use doesn't bother to re-encode the audio (that's what the
    <code>c:a</code>, <code>b:a</code> and <code>r:a</code> bits are about)
    because the audio encoding that ShadowPlay uses itself seems okay to me.
  </li>
  <li>
    I use a slightly lower quality (that's what the “crf” thing is:
    <code>-crf 21</code> is higher quality but bigger files than
    <code>-crf 28</code>).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  (Eagle-eyed readers may also notice that Jernej specifies a
  <code>-strict -2</code> option in order to get aac audio encoding to work, but
  that was only necessary for older versions of ffmpeg.)
</p>

<p>
  If you change <code>-preset slow</code> to <code>-preset slower</code> or
  <code>-preset slowest</code> then you'll tend to get smaller files at the same
  quality, but it'll take longer to encode. I picked
  <code>-preset slow</code> as a tradeoff between how long the files take to
  encode versus how long they take to upload on my internet connection.
</p>

<p>
  I use <code>.mkv</code> as the container format for two reasons. The less
  important reason is that this way I can tell from the name whether a given
  file is an original from ShadowPlay or one that I have recompressed with
  ffmpeg. The originals all have the extension <code>.mp4</code> while the
  recompressed ones all have the extension <code>.mkv</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The more important reason for using <code>.mkv</code> is that YouTube can save
  you time by doing its re-encoding of your videos concurrently with you
  uploading them. If this kicks in, your videos can go live sooner. If it
  doesn't kick in, YouTube won't begin re-encoding your video until the upload
  is completely finished.
</p>

<p>
  Whether concurrent encoding on YouTube kicks in depends on the specifics of
  the container format (like <code>.mkv</code>, <code>.avi</code> or
  <code>.mov</code>) that the video is inside, not the codecs (like h264, Theora
  or MPEG-2). While there are options for ffmpeg that will produce
  <code>.mp4</code> or <code>.avi</code> files that work for concurrent
  encoding, it's much easier to just use <code>.mkv</code> format. Because
  <code>.mkv</code> is well designed for streaming, it just works immediately
  with no fussing.
